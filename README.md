Overview

This project is a basic Railway Reservation System made using Python. It is a small menu-driven program where the user can check train details, book tickets, and view all bookings. The project uses simple Python concepts like lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions. No database or external libraries are used, which makes the project easy to understand and suitable for beginners.
The aim of the project is to show how a simple booking system works and how data can be stored and updated inside a program.

Features

1. View Available Trains
The user can see the list of all trains along with the train number, train name, and how many seats are left.

2. Book a Ticket
The user can choose a train by entering the train number and book a ticket by entering the passenger name.
If seats are available, the booking is successful. If seats are full, the system shows a “No seats available” message.

3. View All Bookings
The user can display all the bookings done so far. This includes the passenger name and the train they booked.

4. Simple Menu System
The program shows a menu again and again until the user chooses to exit, making it easy to use.

5. In-Memory Storage
All the train information and bookings are stored inside the program using lists and dictionaries (no database needed).

6. Handles Invalid Inputs
If the user enters something wrong (like letters instead of numbers), the program gives an error message instead of crashing.

How to run

1.Open terminal or command prompt
2.Navigate to the folder where main.py is saved
3.Run the program using python
